# Dullahan
## Overview
Dullahan is a powerful logging and debugging framework built for [Unity](https://unity3d.com/). It is meant to augment the debugging functionality already built into Unity.
## Features
* Verbose logging support. Include timestamps, method context, and plenty of tags with every logged message.
* Remote use. Dullahan is built from the ground up to network securely between CLIs and Unity instances.
* Command Line Interface. Control and debug the Unity Editor, or a standalone build, from a command line.
* Custom User Commands. Define commands to use for debugging inside your own project's codebase.
